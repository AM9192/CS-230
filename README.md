Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Their Requirements
The Gaming Room client is a successful web-based game application looking to expand their reach by developing a mobile application. They wanted software that could run on both iOS and Android platforms while maintaining the core functionality of their existing game. Their requirements emphasized scalability, cross-platform accessibility, and a seamless user experience.

What I Did Well
I’m really proud of how I organized and detailed the software design document (SDD). It clearly outlined the system requirements, constraints, and architecture, making it easy to reference throughout the project. I think I did particularly well in explaining complex technical concepts, like the use of containerization tools or the benefits of serverless architecture, in a way that anyone could understand.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document
Working through the design document was incredibly helpful for planning and problem-solving. It forced me to think critically about the software’s structure and how each component would interact, which made coding much smoother. Having a clear outline of the requirements and constraints ensured that I stayed on track and met the client’s expectations.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the recommendations section. While I feel it was strong, I would refine the citations and examples to make it even more comprehensive. Adding real-world case studies or more specific cost analyses could make the recommendations more impactful and relatable.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the client’s needs by focusing on scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and user experience. These were central to the design and were implemented by recommending a cloud-based platform, tools like Docker and Kubernetes, and designing with microservices. Considering the user’s needs is critical because the success of any software depends on how well it serves its users. If the design doesn’t align with what the users expect, the software is likely to fail no matter how well it’s built.

Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I approached it by breaking down the requirements into manageable pieces and aligning them with the client’s goals. Using strategies like UML diagrams, microservices design, and containerization helped me visualize the system and ensure it would be scalable and reliable. In the future, I’d continue using these techniques and also integrate user feedback earlier in the process to refine designs before development begins.
